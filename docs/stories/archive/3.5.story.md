## Dev Notes

### Backend Integration Points
**Document Management APIs [Source: Epic 2 completion]:**
- **Document List:** `GET /v1/documents` (user's accessible documents)
- **Document Download:** `GET /v1/documents/:id/download` (secure download)
- **Document Search:** `GET /v1/documents/search` (search and filtering)
- **Document Metadata:** `GET /v1/documents/:id` (document information)

**User Management APIs [Source: Epic 1 completion]:**
- **User List:** `GET /v1/users` (admin access to user management)
- **User Details:** `GET /v1/users/:id` (user profile information)
- **Role Management:** `PUT /v1/users/:id/role` (role assignment)
- **Assignment Management:** User assignment and project management

**Admin APIs [Source: Epic 2 completion]:**
- **Request Approvals:** Approval workflow management
- **System Reports:** Administrative analytics and reporting
- **Configuration:** System settings and configuration

### Technical Requirements
**Frontend Framework:**
- Framework: ✅ **React + TypeScript** (implemented)
- State Management: Centralized state for documents and admin data
- Routing: Protected routes with role-based access
- HTTP Client: Axios or fetch with interceptors

**Design System Integration:**
- **Dashboard Layout:** Use established dashboard design patterns
- **Card Components:** Leverage existing Card component library
- **Typography:** Plus Jakarta Sans with established type scale
- **Colors:** Brand colors and semantic color tokens
- **Spacing:** 8px scale system and responsive breakpoints

**Security & Access Control:**
- **Role-Based Access:** Different interfaces for EOR users vs Ops Admins
- **Document Security:** Secure viewing and download mechanisms
- **Permission Management:** Granular access control for administrative functions
- **Audit Logging:** Track all administrative actions and document access

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- **Document Interface:** Clean, searchable document library
- **Admin Interface:** Professional administrative dashboard
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with established breakpoints
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards

### Testing Strategy
**Unit Testing:**
- Component testing for document and admin interfaces
- Access control logic testing
- Search and filtering functionality

**Integration Testing:**
- API integration testing
- Role-based access control testing
- Document security testing

**E2E Testing:**
