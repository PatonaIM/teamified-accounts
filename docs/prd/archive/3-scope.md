# 3. Scope
## 3.1 In‑Scope (MVP / P0)
- Secure invitations and onboarding (email‑based; one‑time links).
- EOR profile & CV management (personal/contact details, CV upload & version history).
- Timesheets (weekly cadence) with submission, edit before approval, status.
- Leave requests (create/cancel, accrual display optional TBD), status tracking.
- Payslips & employee documents (view/download; handbooks & HR docs).
- Client assignment model (exactly one active client; transition workflow with history).
- Admin console (invite EOR/Admin users, manage roles, administer client team members).
- Multi‑country basics (IN/LK/PH: timezones, date formats, country metadata, holiday placeholders TBD).
- Notifications & reminders (timesheet due, leave status, invite welcome/expiry).
- Audit trail for profile/assignment/approval changes.

## 3.2 Out‑of‑Scope (MVP)
- EOR working across multiple clients simultaneously.
- Full ATS/recruiting, performance reviews, LMS.
- Payroll calculation engine (MVP treats payroll as external; payslips/doc distribution only).
- SSO/MFA (planned as P2 hardening) and complex HR policy engines.
